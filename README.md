You’ve invested considerable time and effort to build an amazing custom app. You’ve customized Salesforce so it does exactly what you need it to do to make your business successful. Now, how do you ensure your end users understand how best to use it? How do you head off those basic “how-to” questions, or give your users tips and training to make them more successful?
